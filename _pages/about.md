👨‍🎓 I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Western Ontario.

💻 My research interests are in medical image processing such as medical image synthesis, tumor segmentation, and detection.

📃 I'm currently working towards my Ph.D. Thesis in the field of "Towards explainable AI for medical image processing".




A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
